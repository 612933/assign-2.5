hadoop cluster:
 A set of connected  computers that work together as a single system is called Cluster. and a computer cluster used for Hadoop is called Hadoop Cluster. 
Hadoop cluster is a special type of computational cluster designed for storing and analyzing vast amount of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment
Large Hadoop Clusters are arranged in several racksthe only thing that is shared between nodes is the network that connects them. .
Hadoop Cluster  consists of:  1.n different tasks.
2.Each rack would have a fix no of slave machine.
3.At the top of each rack there is a rack switch.
4.Each slave machine(rack server in a rack) has cables coming out it from both the ends.
5.Cables are connected to rack switch at the top which means that top rack switch will have around 80 ports.
5.The rack switch has uplinks connected to core switches and hence connecting all other racks with uniform bandwidth, forming the Cluster.
6.In the cluster there are few machines to act as Name node.
7.The majority of the machines acts as DataNode .
2.What is meant by a Rack and explain the rack arrangement in a hadoop cluster

Rack:Storage of several nodes is called rack whereas node is a sigle computer.Network bandwidth between any two nodes in rack is greater than bandwidth between two nodes on different racks
A Hadoop Cluster is a collection of racks.
  1.n different tasks.
2.Each rack would have a fix no of slave machine.
3.At the top of each rack there is a rack switch.
4.Each slave machine(rack server in a rack) has cables coming out it from both the ends.
5.Cables are connected to rack switch at the top which means that top rack switch will have around 80 ports.
5.The rack switch has uplinks connected to core switches and hence connecting all other racks with uniform bandwidth, forming the Cluster.
6.In the cluster there are few machines to act as Name node.
